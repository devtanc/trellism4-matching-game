# Adafruit NeoTrellis M4 Matching Game

This is an improved matching game based on the [example provided by Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/neotrellis-m4-memory-game/overview) with their NeoTrellis M4.

To load it, be sure to set up [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neotrellis-m4/circuitpython) on the board, and then simply copy all the files to the root directory of the board and rename `main.py` to `code.py`. When the board resets, the game will be available to play with game settings able to be accessed by holding the top left-most button down, and exited by holding it again.
